# ü§ñ AI-Powered SEMSEM Robot for Kids with Autism

This is my dissertation project for my Electrical and Communication Engineering degree (2022‚Äì2023), completed at the British University in Egypt.

**SEMSEM** is an interactive 3D-printed robot designed to support autistic children in expressing emotions and improving social interaction through real time emotion detection and gesture based responses.

## üéØ Project Summary

SEMSEM is a 3D-printed robot that combines AI and embedded systems to assist therapists and parents in engaging children with autism. The robot detects facial expressions,
reacts with appropriate behaviors, and interacts through music, hand gestures, and touch based control.

## üß† Key Features

- **Real Time Emotion Detection**  
  Recognizes 7 facial expressions (*happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral*) using a **Pi Camera**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow** with ~71.5% accuracy.

- **Hand Gesture Interaction**  
  AI powered hand tracking triggers activities like games and music based on movement.

- **Touchscreen Interface**  
  Integrated a **Raspberry Pi touchscreen** to display emotional feedback and allow therapists or parents to interact with the robot through a friendly GUI.

- **Custom GUI**  
  Built with **Tkinter** to control robot responses and display real-time detection results.

- **Embedded Hardware**  
  Controlled motors and speaker with **Raspberry Pi 4**, using Python multithreading for smooth, responsive feedback.

## üë©‚Äçüíª My Role

I co-developed this project as one of two team members and took responsibility for:
- Developing the emotion detection model
- Creating the GUI and integrating touchscreen controls
- Implementing gesture based interaction
- Handling hardware wiring, motor control, and real-time syncing
- Troubleshooting system performance and ensuring smooth operation
